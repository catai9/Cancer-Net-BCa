**Note: The Cancer-Net BCa models provided here are intended to be used as reference models that can be built upon and enhanced as new data becomes available. They are currently at a research stage and not yet intended as production-ready models (not meant for direct clinical diagnosis), and we are working continuously to improve them as new data becomes available. Please do not use Cancer-Net BCa for self-diagnosis and seek help from your local health authorities.**

**Cancer-Net BCa is part of the Cancer-Net initiatives, a parallel initiative to the [COVID-Net initiative](https://github.com/lindawangg/COVID-Net).**

Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women in Canada and the United States, representing over 25\% of all new female cancer cases. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment has recently risen in usage as it may result in a patient having a pathologic complete response (pCR), and it can shrink inoperable breast cancer tumors prior to surgery so that the tumor becomes operable, but it is difficult to predict a patientâ€™s pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of leveraging learnt volumetric deep features from a newly introduced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality called synthetic correlated diffusion imaging (CDI\textsuperscript{s}) for the purpose of pCR prediction. More specifically, we leverage a volumetric convolutional neural network to learn volumetric deep radiomic features from a pre-treatment cohort and construct a predictor based on the learnt features using the post-treatment response. As the first study to explore the utility of CDI\textsuperscript{s} within a deep learning perspective for clinical decision support, we evaluated the proposed approach using the ACRIN-6698 study against those learnt using gold-standard imaging modalities, and found that the proposed approach can provide enhanced pCR prediction performance and thus may be a useful tool to aid oncologists in improving recommendation of treatment of patients. Subsequently, this approach to leverage volumetric deep radiomic features (which we name Cancer-Net BCa) can be further extended to other applications of CDI\textsuperscript{s} in the cancer domain to further improve prediction performance.
